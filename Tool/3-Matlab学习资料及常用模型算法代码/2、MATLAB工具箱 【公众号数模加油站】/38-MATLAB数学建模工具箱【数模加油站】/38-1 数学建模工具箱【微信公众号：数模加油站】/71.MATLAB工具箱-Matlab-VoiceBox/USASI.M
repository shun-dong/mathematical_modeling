function x=usasi(n,fs)
%USASI generates N samples of USASI noise at sample frequency FS X=(N,FS)

% This is based on hearsay: I haven't read the actual standard: EIA-549-1988
% It may also be defined in ANSI standard S1.4-1961: General Purpose Sound Meter
% USASI = USA Standards Institute (now ANSI)
% This generates gaussian noise and filters is with zeros at 0Hz & fs/2 and poles at 100 and 320 Hz
% I need to get the scaling correct
