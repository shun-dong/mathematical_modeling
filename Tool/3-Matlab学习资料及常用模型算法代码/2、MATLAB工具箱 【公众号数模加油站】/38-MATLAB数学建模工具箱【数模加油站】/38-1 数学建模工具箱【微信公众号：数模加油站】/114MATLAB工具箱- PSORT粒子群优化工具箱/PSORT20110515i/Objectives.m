%This code associates handle "ObjFun" with the
%appropriate objective function, sets the range and center of the
%search space, and loads a threshold for success
%appropriate for the objective function and problem dimensionality selected (thresholds for
%dimensions other than 2 or 30 will need to be added via additional
%"elseif" statements as desired).  This script is called at the end of
%"Control_Panel.m" and each time the objective function is incremented
%within "RegPSO_main.m."  Note that since "banchmark_id" is incremented
%prior to setting the objective and its search space, the initial
%"objective_id" in "Control_Panel.m" should be set one less than the first
%objective to be used.
