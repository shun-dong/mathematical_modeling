    %Since Merriam Webster's dictionary defines an iteration as "the
    %repetition of a sequence of computer instructions a specified number
    %of times or until a condition is met," the PSO Research Toolbox did
    %not originally count initialization of the swarm at iteration 0 as an
    %"iteration" (i.e. since the velocity and position update equations do
    %not begin until iteration 1 so that the repititious sequence actually
    %begins at iteration 1).  The decision to count initialization as an
    %iteration for sake of straightforward comparison of data with that of
    %other researchers who generally consider initialization of the swarm
    %to be an iteration necessitated a slight change in the formula.
    %This formula differs from the traditional formula for linearly
    %varying the inertia weight only in that Mr. Evers's formula
    %applies the initial inertia weight to the velocity update of 
    %iteration 1 and initializes the swarm at iteration 0,
    %whereas the traditional formula applies the initial
    %inertia weight to iteration 0.  Having
    %the first velocity update occur at iteration 1 makes
    %counting more natural.  Both equations linearly vary the inertia
    %weight - this equation applying the first inertia weight to iteration
    %1 and the other to iteration 0.
