%This toolbox is designed to test new ideas rather than as a product to do
    %one specific thing.  Toward this end, it must be highly flexible and
    %consequently contains many options in this file so that various tweaks
    %do not need to be hard-coded.
%Set preferences according to the sections below.  Only slight changes are
    %usually made from simulation to simulation in order to test the
    %effectiveness of each in a controlled manner.
%(1) In the first section, "BASIC SWITCHES & RELATED ALGORITHMIC SETTINGS," set
        %switches concerning: (a) data to be saved, (b) termination criteria,
        %(c) measures of success, (d) the core PSO to be used by RegPSO,
        %and (e) histories to be maintained for analysis.
%(2) in the "BASIC SETTINGS" section, set basic variables such as # of
        %trials, velocity clamping percentage,
        %problem dimensionality, swarm size, acceleration constants, static or
        %linear inertia weight value(s)*, number of function evaluations or
        %iterations*, and the format used to display values.
    %* depending on the switches activated in the first section
%(3) If RegPSO was activated in section "(1) BASIC SWITCHES & PSO
        %ALGORITHMIC SELECTION," the following instructions related to
        %section "(3) REGROUPING SWITCHES & SETTINGS" may be useful.
    %If regrouping was activated via switch "OnOff_RegPSO," select the
        %stagnation threshold, "stag_thresh," used for detecting premature
        %convergence, and specify which of the following should be retained
        %for post-simulation analysis: (a) the range of the search space,
        %"range_IS," used for each regrouping, (b) the update number after
        %which each regrouping occurred, (c) the function value of the
        %global best prior to each regrouping, and (d) the global best
        %(i.e. globally best position) prior to each regrouping.
    %"OnOff_num_gs_identical_b4_refinement" is optional.  Activate it only
        %if you want the regrouping range, "range_IS," to be reduced by
        %factor "reg_reduction_factor" with each regrouping after
        %"num_gs_identical_b4_refinement" regroupings have returned the
        %same rounded global best.  This was briefly tested as a means
        %to begin the solution refinement phase, but is included here as a
        %courtesy rather as a required setting and can be ignored by
        %new users. "reg_reduction_factor" determines how aggressively the
        %reduction will be done.
    %Activate "OnOff_see_data_per_grouping" if you want to monitor how
        %progress is being made over the course of the regroupings by
        %outputting relevant data before each regrouping.
    %Set the parameters specific to RegPSO.
    %Set the maximum number of function evaluations or iterations per trial
        %or simulation (i.e. over all groupings conducted within that trial),
        %which is different than the maximum number per grouping set at the
        %end of section "(2) BASIC SETTINGS."
    %Set the maximum # of groupings.  This is generally set to a very large
        %number such as 99999999 so that there is effectively no limit.
%(4) When conducting multiple trials, each column generated will contain
        %the median, mean, min, max, and standard deviation of the trials'
        %final function values.
    %Note: The features of this section are only available in the full
        %professional version of the toolbox.
	%Select more than one table if you would like to increment the objective,
        %c1, or c2 per table.  Then activate one or more of
        %"TableParams_OnOff_Tbl_Incr_objective," "TableParams_OnOff_c1_increment,"
        %"TableParams_OnOff_c2_increment" in order to specify which is to
        %be incremented.  To increment an acceleration coefficient,
        %select the values of the increment via "TableParams_c1_increment"
        %or "TableParams_c2_increment."
    %To automatically increment the inertia weight, swarm size,
        %velocity clamping percentage, or either increment or scale the
        %regrouping factor, (a) set the minimum number of columns per table
        %via "TableParams_min_num_unique_columns," (b) select the variable
        %to be automatically changed via "TableParams_OnOff_Col...,"
        %(c) specify via switches "...leftward_only" and "... rightward_only"
        %whether all increments should be forced in either the leftward
        %(i.e. negative) direction or rightward (i.e. positive) direction
        %rather than allowing the program in some cases to determine which
        %direction seems most promising, and (d) select how much change is
        %desired per step.
%(5) Activate or disable graphing via main graphing switch "OnOff_graphs."
        %If activated, the switches in the "OPTIONAL GRAPHS" subsection
        %determine which graphs will be generated using the "GRAPH
        %SETTINGS" specified.
%(6) Set the objective id to specify which objective or objectives will be
        %executed.  The mapping from "objective_id" to objective name is
        %set in "Objectives.m."
    %Specify the true global minimum of the objective(s) so that if it is
        %ever reached by a trial, the search will terminate rather than
        %wasting time.
