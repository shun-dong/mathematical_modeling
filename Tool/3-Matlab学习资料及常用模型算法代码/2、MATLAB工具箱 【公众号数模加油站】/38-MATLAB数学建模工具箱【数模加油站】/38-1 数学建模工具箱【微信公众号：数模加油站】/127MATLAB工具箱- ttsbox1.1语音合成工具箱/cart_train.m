% function cart=tts_train_cart(father_node)
%
% Recursively builds a cart tree from father_node
% Members of father_node are assumed to be given as a vector of strings. 
% The first character of each string is the feature to predict; the others are context features
% Cart is a nested cell array of{question,yes_cart,no_cart}, unless father_node is a leaf.
% In this case, cart is a simple question of type {0,decision}
