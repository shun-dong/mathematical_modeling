function entropy=set_compute_entropy(set1,set2)

% Computes the entropy of a set of characters
% ex : set_compute_entropy(['aaaabbbb']) gives 1 bit
%
% When used with 2 input arguments, computes the entropy of two sets of characters, 
% as a weighted sum of the respective entropies of each set
% Sets are typically the child nodes after splitting a father node in a cart
% ex : set_compute_entropy(['aaaabbbb'],['ccccccdddddd']) gives 1 bit
